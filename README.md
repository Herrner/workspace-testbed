## Presence Overview Feature

This repository includes a feature to display the presence of people in the office for the next two weeks based on the zfdm calendar.

### How to Use

1. Ensure you have the necessary credentials to access the zfdm calendar.
2. Run the `main.py` script.
3. The script will fetch items from the zfdm calendar, parse them for people names, and determine their presence in the office.
4. The presence information for the next two weeks will be displayed in an easy-to-understand way.

### Example Output

```
Presence overview for the next two weeks:
Alice:
  - 2023-04-01
  - 2023-04-03
Bob:
  - 2023-04-05
```
